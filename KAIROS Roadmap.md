# KAIROS Project Roadmap

This document outlines the planned features, enhancements, and strategic direction for the KAIROS project. Our goal is to continuously evolve KAIROS into the most intelligent, comprehensive, and user-friendly web reconnaissance framework available for ethical cybersecurity professionals.

This roadmap is a living document and may be subject to change based on community feedback, emerging threats, and technological advancements.

## Guiding Principles for Development

*   **Intelligence & Automation:** Enhance K.A.I. capabilities for smarter data correlation, risk assessment, and adaptive scanning.
*   **Comprehensiveness:** Expand detection capabilities for new technologies, vulnerabilities, and misconfigurations.
*   **Usability & Accessibility:** Improve user experience through better reporting, clearer outputs, and potentially alternative interfaces.
*   **Ethical Core:** Ensure all new features adhere strictly to the ethical mandate of KAIROS.
*   **Community Driven:** Actively incorporate feedback and contributions from the KAIROS community.
*   **Performance & Scalability:** Optimize for speed and resource efficiency, especially for larger targets.

## Current Version: 3.6 "Zenith Prime"

*   Focus on stability, enhanced core module functionality, improved reporting, and refined CLI.
*   Strengthened JS analysis, API discovery, and sitemap processing.
*   See `README.md` and `CHANGELOG.md` (if available) for detailed features of the current version.

## Short-Term Goals (Next 1-3 Major Releases)

### Q3-Q4 2024: "Apex Insight" (Tentative v4.0)

*   **Enhanced Vulnerability Correlation:**
    *   [ ] **Internal CVE Database (Conceptual):** Begin research into integrating a lightweight, locally updatable CVE mapping for common software identified (e.g., CMS versions, server software).
    *   [ ] **Risk Scoring Heuristics:** Develop a basic internal scoring system based on the severity and count of findings to provide a high-level risk posture summary.
*   **JSpector™ v1.5 - Dynamic Tainting (Experimental):**
    *   [ ] Introduce experimental capabilities for basic dynamic JavaScript analysis to trace data flows for potential DOM XSS or sensitive data leakage (requires careful sandboxing considerations).
*   **Advanced API Analysis:**
    *   [ ] Deeper parsing of OpenAPI/Swagger: Extract parameter types, authentication methods, and example requests.
    *   [ ] Basic automated testing for common API vulnerabilities (e.g., unauthenticated endpoints from spec, basic IDOR checks on listed paths - with EXTREME caution and user opt-in).
*   **Reporting v2.0:**
    *   [ ] Add filtering and sorting capabilities to HTML reports.
    *   [ ] Include more visual elements (e.g., simple charts for finding distributions).
    *   [ ] Option for detailed JSONL (JSON Lines) output for easier log ingestion.
*   **Configuration Enhancements:**
    *   [ ] Profile-based configurations in `config_kairos.json` (e.g., "stealth", "aggressive", "api_focused").

### Q1 2025: "Quantum Leap" (Tentative v4.5)

*   **K.A.I. Heuristic Engine v2.0:**
    *   [ ] Implement a more sophisticated rule-based system for identifying chained vulnerabilities or complex misconfigurations (e.g., exposed .git config + publicly accessible repo URL).
    *   [ ] Adaptive scanning logic: Adjust scan intensity or module priority based on initial findings (e.g., if a sensitive API spec is found, prioritize API-related checks).
*   **Extended Cloud Reconnaissance:**
    *   [ ] Deeper analysis of identified cloud storage URLs (S3, GCS, Azure Blobs) for common misconfigurations (e.g., public bucket listing, if detectable passively).
    *   [ ] Identification of more cloud-specific metadata or exposed identifiers.
*   **Web Application Firewall (WAF) Detection & Evasion (Basic):**
    *   [ ] Basic WAF fingerprinting based on HTTP responses and headers.
    *   [ ] Research into common, non-intrusive WAF bypass techniques for specific checks (requires significant ethical consideration and user control).
*   **Internationalization (i18n) Support:**
    *   [ ] Prepare codebase for localization of reports and CLI messages.

## Medium-Term Goals (Next 6-12 Months)

*   **JSpector™ v2.0 - Full Dynamic Analysis:**
    *   [ ] Integration with a headless browser or sandboxed JS execution environment for comprehensive dynamic analysis of client-side code.
*   **GUI / Web Interface (Proof of Concept):**
    *   [ ] Develop a basic web-based GUI for easier scan initiation, configuration, and report viewing.
*   **Plugin/Extension Architecture:**
    *   [ ] Design and implement a modular plugin system to allow the community to extend KAIROS with custom checks or reporting modules.
*   **Threat Intelligence Integration (Basic):**
    *   [ ] Allow optional integration with open-source threat intelligence feeds (e.g., check IPs/domains against blocklists).
*   **Containerization:**
    *   [ ] Provide official Docker images for easier deployment and consistent environments.

## Long-Term Vision (Beyond 12 Months / "Singularity Core")

*   **Advanced K.A.I. - Machine Learning Integration:**
    *   [ ] Explore the use of ML models for anomaly detection in website behavior, advanced vulnerability prediction, and intelligent prioritization of findings.
*   **Comprehensive Post-Recon Verification (Ethical & Opt-in):**
    *   [ ] Carefully designed modules to ethically verify certain classes of vulnerabilities (e.g., non-intrusive confirmation of an open redirect). This will require very stringent controls and user understanding.
*   **Distributed Scanning Capabilities:**
    *   [ ] Architecture for distributing scan tasks across multiple nodes for very large-scale reconnaissance.
*   **Full API for Integration:**
    *   [ ] A well-documented REST API for KAIROS to allow seamless integration into larger security workflows and platforms.
*   **KAIROS Community Hub:**
    *   [ ] A platform for sharing custom check scripts, configurations, and reconnaissance knowledge.

## Modules/Features Under Consideration (Research Phase)

*   [ ] **WebSockets Analysis:** Deeper inspection of WebSocket communications.
*   [ ] **Mobile Endpoint Discovery:** Specific heuristics for identifying mobile application backend APIs.
*   [ ] **Password Audit (Passive):** Checking for leaked credentials associated with the domain in public breaches (requires API integration with services like HIBP).
*   [ ] **Subdomain Takeover Detection:** More robust checks for potential subdomain takeovers.
*   [ ] **Visual Reconnaissance:** Capturing screenshots of web pages, especially for subdomains or error pages.
